<h3>About me</h3>
<p>I have been planning the move towards a career in Web Development for the last few years.  Recent events have allowed me to pursue my dream.  The ability to create and change, using code, has always fascianted me.  I am excited at the prospect of being part of a team of programmers!</p>

<p>When I'm not working, I can usually be found enjoying outdoor activities.  I love taking nature walks, going to the beach, bicycle riding, or running.</p>
